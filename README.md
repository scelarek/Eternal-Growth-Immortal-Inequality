By analyzing econometric data from Gapminder, this project aims to explore the relationship between wealth,  inequality, and human flourishing. 

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The data for this project comes primarily from **Gapminder**, which provides a plethora of indicators related to the health, happiness, and economic welfare of nations. Gapminder collects data from various sources worldwide, enabling a comprehensive understanding of global economic trends.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Wrangling
The data underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability. Techniques such as imputation, filling, trimming, and column removal were used to handle missing data and make it more suitable for analysis.

## ðŸ‘“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved assessing various economic indicators to determine patterns, correlations, and insights. Here is a quick sample of one of the data visualizations:

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Performance
The project's findings were exploratory in nature as no models were built. However there were four key correlations observations: 

1. **The Welfare of Nations**:
   - There's a positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness.
   - Richer countries generally have lower murder rates and more civic freedom.
   - The relationship between GDP per capita and murder rates is tenuous due to missing data.

2. **Rich Man, Poor World**:
   - A strong positive association exists between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions.
   - However, the richest countries have seen CO2 emissions decrease over the past 30 years, even as their GDP increased, suggesting a potential dissociation between the two.

3. **Progress and Poverty**:
   - Contrary to expectations, there's a negative correlation between GDP per capita and economic inequality (Gini coefficient).
   - The trend suggests that richer countries tend to have less economic inequality, but this observation is based on limited data.

4. **The Gini's Curse**:
   - Economic inequality (Gini coefficient) weakly correlates with decreased happiness and freedom.
   - There's a moderate correlation between high inequality and increased murder rates, but this is based on sparse data.
